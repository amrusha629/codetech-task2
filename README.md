OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT Project: student grade tracker 

OBJECTIVE: Objective of the Project: The objective of this project is to create a simple grading system where a user inputs the marks for five subjects, and the program calculates the average and determines the corresponding grade based on predefined thresholds. Outcome: The outcome is a program that can assist teachers or students in quickly calculating grades based on the average marks.
Key Activities of the Project: Input Collection: Collect marks from the user for five different subjects. Average Calculation: Compute the average of the collected marks. Grade Determination: Compare the average against defined grade thresholds and determine the corresponding grade. Output Display: Display the determined grade to the user. Testing & Debugging: Ensure that the program handles various inputs correctly and provides accurate results. Enhancements: Potential future activities could include adding more subjects, handling different grading scales, or allowing input validation.
